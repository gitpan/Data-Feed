Changes
=======

0.00015 - 06 Jul 2011
  - Fix perl 5.14 qw() deprecation warnings (theory)
  - Add extract_node_values() to access arbitrary node values (LibXML only) (theory)
  - Fix stupid typo in Item class

0.00014 - 22 Jun 2010
  - Added `icon()` accessor to the feed classes. (theory)
  - Added `base()` accessor to the feed classes (requires XML::RSS::LibXML
    0.3006 for RSS support). (theory)
  - Missing descriptions and contents from parsed RSS feeds are now set to
    empty strings instead of throwing an exception. Such was already the case
    for parsed Atom feeds. (theory)
  - Missing type attributes in parsed enclosures no longer trigger an
    exception, but are set to an empty string. (theory)

0.00013 - 3 Jun 2010
  - Made RSS enclosure parsing more tolerant of empty length values, as was
    already the case with Atom enclosure parsing. (theory)
  - 'feed' and 'entry' attributes are now moved down to the actual implementors,
    so that the interaction is a bit cleaner.
  - Remove List::Util dependency

0.00012 - 3 Jun 2010
  - Added `parse_datetime()`, `parse_w3cdtf_date()`, and `parse_mail_date()`.
    These methods are used to parse dates from the feeds. (theory)

0.00011 - 18 Feb 2010
  - Tweak regexp (franckcuny)
  - Use LWP instead of URI::Fetch (franckcuny)
  - Moose-y fixes (franckcuny)

0.00010 - 31 Jul 2009
  - Allow initialization of fields feed/item

0.00009 - 20 Mar 2009
  - No changes to code, just use newer M::I::Any::Moose

0.00008 - 19 Mar 2009
  - Any::Moose me!

0.00007 - 21 Oct 2008
  - Fix a bunch of minor problems.
    * as_xml() properly implemented
    * Creating feeds is now much more functional
    * Add tagline()
  - Added selected tests fro XML::Feed 0.21 for more coverage

0.00006 - 08 Sep 2008
  - Recent versions of Moose (properly) unimport blessed() and confess(), 
    which breaks my code depending on it.

0.00005 - 06 Aug 2008
  - Attempt to fix tests by using Test::UseAllModules (rt #38233)

0.00004 - 06 Aug 2008
  - Make XML::RSS::LibXML a hard dependency (rt #38173)
    While CPAN will force you to install XML::RSS::LibXML, you /can/
    use XML::RSS as the backend parser. However, some features,
    such as enclosures, will not properly work.
  - Allow specification of RSS parser via DATA_FEED_RSS_PARSERS
    environment variable
  - Fix bugs calling methods from a previous life that no longer exist
  - Make tests not rely on slow network connection

0.00003 - 28 Jul 2008
  - Add media_contents() so that MediaRSS can be handled (33rpm)
  - Tweak the tests to make network-dependent tests more reliable
  - Silence potential warnings

0.00002 - 25 Jul 2008
  - Update dependencies
  - Fix network detection

0.00001 - 24 Jul 2008
  - Initial release
