0.00008 - 19 Mar 2009

0.00007 - 21 Oct 2008
  - Fix a bunch of minor problems.
    * as_xml() properly implemented
    * Creating feeds is now much more functional
    * Add tagline()
  - Added selected tests fro XML::Feed 0.21 for more coverage

0.00006 - 08 Sep 2008
  - Recent versions of Moose (properly) unimport blessed() and confess(), 
    which breaks my code depending on it.

0.00005 - 06 Aug 2008
  - Attempt to fix tests by using Test::UseAllModules (rt #38233)

0.00004 - 06 Aug 2008
  - Make XML::RSS::LibXML a hard dependency (rt #38173)
    While CPAN will force you to install XML::RSS::LibXML, you /can/
    use XML::RSS as the backend parser. However, some features,
    such as enclosures, will not properly work.
  - Allow specification of RSS parser via DATA_FEED_RSS_PARSERS
    environment variable
  - Fix bugs calling methods from a previous life that no longer exist
  - Make tests not rely on slow network connection

  - Tweak the tests to make network-dependent tests more reliable
  - Silence potential warnings
